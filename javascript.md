# Javascript Fundamentals Review

## Primative Data Types

Javascript has several basic data types:

```javascript
'this is a string' // string (text)
123 // number (int)
1.2 // number (float)
true // boolean
false // boolean
```

## Variables

Declaring variables is done with the keyword `var`.  Variables are dynamically typed (decided during execution) since there is no compilation process.

```javascript
var foo = 'string';
var bar = 1;
```

Variables can be reassigned to any other value by omitting the var keyword

```javascript
var foo = 'a string';
foo = 123.4;
```

## Functions and Scope
## Objects/Arrays
## Equality
## Control Flow (loops, if/else)
## Functions are objects
## Events
## Callbacks
## Asynchronicity
## Constructor Functions
